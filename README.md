      Note: Replace the placeholders with your actual configuration values.

Configuration
AWS Cognito
Ensure you have created a User Pool and App Client in AWS Cognito.
Update the .env file with your Cognito User Pool ID, App Client ID, and AWS region.
API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend via the REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL.
Ensure the backend API is running and accessible.
OpenAI Integration
Obtain your OpenAI API key and set it in the .env file.
Salesforce Integration
Configure the Salesforce API endpoint and ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place on the backend.
Development
Running the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Building for Production
To build the app for production, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will create an optimized production build in the build/ folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

Deployment
Deploying to AWS S3 and CloudFront
Build the Project:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Configure AWS CLI:

Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions.

Sync Build with S3 Bucket:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-s3-bucket-name --delete
Invalidate CloudFront Cache (if applicable):

bash
Copy code
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
Note: Replace YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID with your actual CloudFront distribution ID.
